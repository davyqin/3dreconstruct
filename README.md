3dreconstruct
=============
This project is designed as a Qt Creator project. That means it can be opened, modified, built by Qt Creator with needed libs.

Currently I'm working with Qt 5.2.1 and Qt Creator 3.0.1 on Windows and Linux. The boost and glm are needed for compilation. For Windows, the boost should be built by mingw.

v1.0 is tagged. The 3D reconstrcution is finished.
